    "\n",
    "The problem at hand is to build a predictive model that can answer the question: \"What sorts of people were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic?\" The sinking of the Titanic is a historical event where, due to a collision with an iceberg during its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, a significant number of passengers lost their lives. The challenge is to analyze passenger data, including attributes such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc., and predict which passengers were more likely to survive based on these characteristics.*\n",
